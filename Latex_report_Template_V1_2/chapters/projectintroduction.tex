\subsection{Purpose of this document}
\label{sec:purpose}
This document serves as a documentation for the project ``Data Collection and Preparation for Currency Adaptation``which is carried out in the scope of the BFH module ``Project 2``  BTI7302. \par
The client of the project is the company CI Tech Sensors AG (subsequently referred to as CI Tech) and the project is supervised on the part of CI Tech by Lukas Burger, head of application software.

The project is supervised on the part of BFH by Prof. Mascha Kurpicz-Briki.

\subsection{Vision}
In the scope of this project a process for the data collection and preparation for the currency adaptation workflow should be developed.
Namely, the currency data needed to train and develop algorithms in CI Tech's currency recognition and classification framework should be provided as centralized labelled data sets. These data sets can be generated automatically from the centralized Data Pool, they are version controlled and a uniform process for their updating and management will be implemented.
With this change, it will be possible to directly track the influence a new banknote recording has on an existing currency recognition software. Also it will be possible to use dedicated sub-data sets for training specific algorithms, for example data sets consisting of banknotes with a dogear.
