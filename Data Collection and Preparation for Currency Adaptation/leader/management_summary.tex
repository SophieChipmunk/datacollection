In this project concepts and methods for collecting and preparing data for Currency Adaption are presented, in the context of the company CI Tech Sensors in Burgdorf.
The currency data needed to train and develop algorithms in CI Tech's currency recognition and classification framework should be provided as centralized labelled data sets. These data sets should be generated automatically from the centralized Data Lake. This project proposes a new data container ``NoteSet``, as well as exemplary workflows to achieve this goal.
The implementation was done in Python and using the Jupyter Notebook environment.
